"""Shared report-boundary guidance and SQL boundary checks.

Report tools expose measured Nsight Systems evidence, but a few product
boundaries are easy for agents to cross while working with reports:

* local cache/output paths are implementation details and must stay hidden;
* recipe/domain metrics such as communication/compute overlap require a
  recipe-owned workflow, not an ad-hoc raw-table query.

Keep this module declarative and tied to the reviewed capability contract.  It
is intentionally not an eval router: callers pass user/question context when
available, and SQL receives structured warnings instead of being rejected when
it approaches unsupported recipe/domain semantics.
