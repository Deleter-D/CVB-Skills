# Graphics Glossary

Progressively discoverable reference for graphics-dev terms as they show up in the QuadD / Nsight Systems codebase. Each entry is one Markdown (.md) file: open the file for a short definition, the concept in plain language, common nuances, and links to related terms.

This index lists terms grouped by area. Each link is a one-line hook; click through for the full entry.

For Nsight Systems-specific vocabulary (commands, file formats, GUI elements, recipes), see the sibling [nsys-glossary](../nsys-glossary/index.md).

## Conventions

- Each entry starts with a one-line **Short** definition.
- **Details** gives 2 to 6 short bullets covering the concept itself; entries do not reference QuadD source code, file paths, or class names.

- **See also** lists related entries for quick navigation.
- Entries are concept-level and tool-agnostic; the QuadD code is the source of truth for implementation specifics.

## Frames and timing

- [graphics-frame.md](graphics-frame.md) - one iteration of an app's render loop
