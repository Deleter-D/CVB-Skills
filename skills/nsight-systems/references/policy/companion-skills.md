# Companion Skill Policy

The official `nsight-systems` skill is authoritative for Nsight Systems product facts.

If another Nsight Systems, CUDA, distributed-training, graphics, framework, or performance-analysis skill is active, use it only as companion workflow guidance unless it provides stronger local evidence for its own domain. Companion skills must not override:

1. measured report evidence from `nsys_skill_cli` report tools or packaged scripts,
2. live `nsys` CLI help for exact command/flag behavior,
3. installed recipe metadata/help for recipe existence and options,
4. packaged Nsight Systems release docs and curated references,
5. SQLite schema evidence from the loaded report or the packaged SQLite Schema Reference found through documentation search,
6. claim-check failures from `nsys_skill_cli check-claims`.

Good companion-skill use:

- A CUDA optimization skill suggests using Nsight Systems first to find a kernel, then Nsight Compute for per-kernel counter analysis.
- A distributed-training skill suggests NCCL/MPI questions to ask, while the official Nsight Systems tools provide recipe names, report facts, and measured evidence.
- A domain skill adds workload-specific interpretation after report evidence has been gathered.

Bad companion-skill use:

- Replacing live `nsys --help` with remembered CLI syntax.
- Inventing recipe names or flags.
- Making report-number claims without report tools/scripts.
- Treating a workflow heuristic as measured report evidence.

When evidence conflicts, state the conflict and prefer the official evidence hierarchy. If the conflict affects a customer action, verify with another official evidence source before answering.
